## User Stories

- As a new user, I want to be able to easily enter a chat room so I can quickly start talking to my friends and family.
- As a user, I want to be able to send messages to my friends and family members to exchange the latest news.
- As a user, I want to send images to my friends to show them what Iâ€™m currently doing.
- As a user, I want to share my location with my friends to show them where I am.
- As a user, I want to be able to read my messages offline so I can reread conversations at any time.
- As a user with a visual impairment, I want to use a chat app that is compatible with a screen reader so that I can engage with a chat interface.

## Key Features

- A page where users can enter their name and choose a background color for the chat screen before joining the chat.
- A page displaying the conversation, as well as an input field and submit button.
- The chat must provide users with two additional communication features: sending images and location data.
- Data gets stored online and offline.


## Permissions

When the user decides to send a picture or share their location, the app will ask permission to access the camera roll and/or the user's location.
Granting the access to the app is necessary for the app to work correctly.
No data gets used or sent without the user's permission.
The data is stored locally on the user's device, and synched with the Firestore database when the device goes online.
The images are stored on Firebase Storage.
